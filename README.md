Node-Cards is a command-line application that will generate 'cards' based on user input to gather and display basic employee information for those working on a specific team. 

Areas of further development:

1. I have not be able to fix the issue of commas which appear on the output pages between each index of my "....Cards" arrays(s). This formatting issue must be resolved.

2. Additonally formatting to the "output/main.html" pages to include section headings would look cleaner and more organized. I.e. the application appends each "....Cards" arrays to it's designated and label section for "Managers", "Engineers", and "Interns".

3. I would like to add features that allow the user, from the html page, to delete a specific card, and also a feature to clear all cards and refresh the application. At present, this application can only be used one time through, otherwise the html must be altered manually before you can use it again. 

4. Once there is a server set up that allows storage of information on this sites API, I would be able to change the flow of my application to fill out the API at the end of each command instead of arrays filled with html-formatted strings, which I would then allow to dynamically fill each navigatable page. 

5. Additionally, if the user was a manager of many project teams, a feature that allows them to navigate their multiple project teams would be useful. Likely this would be added with a menu toggle that allows the user to click through different stored datasets and dynamically fill each output page.
